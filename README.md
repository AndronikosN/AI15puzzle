# AI15puzzle
### This code was created as a personal project for solving the 15 puzzle using AI

## Algorithms used:
1. IDS - Iterative Deepening Search
2. A*

**Iterative Deepening Search** is an iterative graph searching strategy that takes advantage 
of the completeness of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) strategy but uses much less memory in each iteration.

**A-star** search algorithm is one of the best and popular technique used in path-finding and graph traversals, 
unlike other traversal techniques, it has “brains”.
What it means is that it is really a smart algorithm which separates it from the other conventional algorithms.

## Use guide
At first when you run this code, you'll see the random board that was generated by the function shuffle
then you can choose which algorith to use to solve the puzzle
